# Data-Warehousing
## Statement
Given the ACME-Flying Use Case, this project aims to design a Data Warehouse that allows perform descriptive analysis based in three parts:
1. Creation of a multidimensional database design that allows a correct execution of the queries. To draw the multidimensional schema the graphical editor draw.io was used.
2. Develop an ETL process that allows to extract, transform and load the data from existing databases to the developed database in the previous step with the `pygramtel` Python library.
3. Compare the execution time of the queries over the data sources and over the multidimensional schemas in the data warehouse implemented in DuckDB.
